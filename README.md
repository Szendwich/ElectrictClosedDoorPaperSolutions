Old "written examination" exercises and their solution in .NET &amp; C#

## VZH1

### Relatively Prime
>Write a program that reads two positive integers separated by a comma and prints the word "yes" or "no" to the screen depending on whether the numbers are relatively prime.
(Two or more numbers are called relatively prime if their greatest common divisor is 1.)

| Input  | Output |
| ------ | ------ |
| 12,121 |    yes |
| 16,72  |     no |
| 26,49  |    yes |

### Number of combinations of n based on k without repetition
>Write a program that reads two positive integers (n, k) and prints the number of combinations of n based on k without repetition (where n is k). 
Assume that n and k are between 0 and 10.

| Input  | Output |
| ------ | ------ |
| 6,4    |     15 |
| 9,3    |     84 |

### Number to text (Hungarian!!!)
>Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 100 and prints its text form on the screen without accents. Hungarian language!!!

| Input  | Output       |
| ------ | ------------ |
| 1      |          egy |
| 42     | negyvenketto |

### Nearest square number
>Write a program that reads a positive integer and prints its distance from the nearest square number! 
(The distance between two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.)

| Input  | Output |
| ------ | ------ |
| 45     |      4 |

### Longest Interval
>Write a program that reads five pairs of numbers (ten integers separated by commas).
The pairs of numbers represent the start and end points of intervals.The program prints the length of the longest interval!
(It can be assumed that the first member of the pairs of numbers is less than the second.)

| Input                           | Output |
| ------------------------------- | ------ |
| -12,-2,34,56,4,100,65,83,-45,23 |     96 |

### Greatest Common Subinterval
>Write a program that reads three pairs of integers (six integers separated by commas).
The program prints the length of the greatest common subinterval of the intervals!
(It can be assumed that the first member of the pairs of numbers is less than the second.)

| Input          | Output |
| -------------- | ------ |
| 1,5,3,10,0,2   |      0 |
| -5,2,-3,1,-7,0 |      3 |

### Cube root
>Write a program that reads an integer (n) and prints the number of cubes between 0 and n!
(A cube is a number whose cube root is an integer.)

| Input  | Output |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0      |      1 |
| 9      |      3 |
| -10    |      3 |
| 1024   |     11 |
